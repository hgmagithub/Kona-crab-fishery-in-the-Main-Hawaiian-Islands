# Characteristics of the Kona crab fishery in the Main Hawaiian Islands
## Hongguang Ma, Toby Matthews, Leonardo Durante, and Felipe Carvalho
The catch, catch rate, and fishing effort for Kona crab in the main Hawaiian Islands were investigated to determine the need for conducting a stock assessment. The current annual catch limit (ACL) for Kona crab in the main Hawaiian Islands is 30,802 lb based on results from the latest stock assessment (Kapur et al. 2019). In the years since the assessment, the annual commercial catch was always less than 6,000 lb, well below the ACL. The commercial catch reported from inshore reporting areas (extending to ~2 nautical miles from shore) accounted for more than 80% of the total commercial catch in 2014-2024. Before then, catch from Penguin Bank (> 3 nautical miles from shore, in federal waters) accounted for 50% of the total catch. However, there was minimal catch reported from Penguin Bank since 2014 and catch from federal waters as a whole was minor. The inshore reporting areas for the commercial Fisher Reporting System (FRS) only extend to about 2 nautical miles from shore and do not include all state waters, which extend to 3 nautical miles from shore. The actual annual catch in state waters may have accounted for ~90% or more of the total catch in 2014-2024. Considering the recent low annual commercial catch (average of 3,400 lb or 10% of ACL) and the small proportion of total catch in federal waters, an update stock assessment for Kona crab may not be warranted at this time.
